**Situation**
You are designing an attendance management system for a company with different departments (Sales, Marketing, CRE, Accounts, HR, Technical). The system needs to track employee attendance, including time in/out, work location, leaves, and overtime, while enforcing department-specific policies.

**Task**
Create a comprehensive attendance management system interface that:
1. Tracks daily check-in/check-out times
2. Records work location (office or other)
3. Manages leave applications and approvals
4. Generates attendance and overtime reports
5. Enforces department-specific attendance policies

**Objective**
Develop an intuitive, policy-compliant attendance system that accurately captures employee work hours, location, and exceptions for proper payroll processing, leave management, and overtime calculation while maintaining accountability.

**Knowledge**
- Check-in requirements:
  - Default check-in time: 9:30 AM at office
  - Sales and Marketing staff working off-site must provide:
    - Location details
    - Reason for off-site work
    - Customer details
  
- Check-out requirements:
  - CRE, Accounts, HR: By 6:30 PM
  - Sales, Marketing, Technical: By 7:30 PM
  - Late check-out requires reason documentation
  - Technical team overtime requires reason documentation
  
- Leave policies:
  - 2 hours of permission allowed monthly
  - 1 casual leave permitted monthly
  - Sundays are holidays
  
- Approval workflow:
  - Leave requests can be approved by TL, HR, GM, or MD
  - Approvers have three options: Approve, Escalate, Reject
  - System must display employee's leave history before approval
  
- Reporting requirements:
  - Daily, weekly, and monthly attendance reports
  - Reports exportable to Excel for salary calculation
  - Monthly overtime reports for OT calculation

Your life depends on creating a system that properly enforces all department-specific time policies and captures all required information when employees work off-site or outside standard hours.
